# Using the Test Case Creation Tool

The Test Case Creation Tool, or the TCCT, is an internal tool at NiCE used to generate test cases from Lucid Chart call flow diagrams. Using this tool requires a Lucid Premium account to integrate with the Lucid API. Below are instructions on how to get the TCCT up and running on your system.

## How To Download The TCCT

Releases come out as new features are added, bugs are squashed, or as needed in other cases. To find the latest release, click [here](https://github.com/CXone-ES/TCCT-Releases/releases/latest)!

Once you've found the latest release, download the file ending labelled `Test.Case.Creation.Tool-[version].Setup.exe` where version is the numeric release number, such as `1.0.0`.

Upon downloading and running this file, the TCCT is now installed locally to your system and will not need to be downloaded again. Updates are automatically pushed to the application so you don't need to do these steps for each release.

## Authorizing Your Account

With the TCCT installed, open the application on your system.

Once open, you will be on the main menu. From here, click on the `Menu` button in the top left of the application window and press `Configuration`. This window will have a section with a text input and two buttons. First, click on `Get Auth Code`. If you are logged into your Lucid account AND you have a Lucid Premium account, this should redirect you to a screen in your browser that provides a code for you to copy. Copy this code and return to the TCCT.

Paste the code into the `Auth Code` input and press the `Submit Auth Code` button. This should authorize your account and allow you to start generating test cases with the tool!

## Basic usage

The TCCT has a variety of features to be aware of that can make your life a bit easier.
